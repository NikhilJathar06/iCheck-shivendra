Enrolment in a Condition Assessment Programme is voluntary and, where utilised, may provide a complete view of a ship addressing the risks of pollution, structural failure and machinery downtime.

A CAP rating has no validity date, but only reflects the condition of the vessel on the date of the onboard inspection. Each charterer defines the time validity of a CAP certificate within its own vetting and marine assurance procedures.

Condition Assessment Programmes differ depending upon which classification society is commissioned to assess the condition of a vessel, but common modules are:

�	Hull structure.
�	Propulsion and auxiliary systems.
�	Cargo equipment and systems.
�	Cargo containment systems (for LPG and LNG Carriers).
�	Machinery and cargo systems combined.
�	Bridge, navigation and radio equipment.

This question will only be generated for vessels that have passed their fifteenth anniversary from the initial delivery date and, where the vessel operator had declared that the vessel had been awarded a CAP rating in at least one module.
Where a vessel had been subject to a Condition Assessment Programme, the vessel operator should have declared the following through the pre-inspection questionnaire:

6.5 The Company should establish and maintain procedures for identifying any training which may be required in support of the SMS and ensure that such training is provided for all personnel concerned.
","Inspection Guidance

The vessel operator should have developed a procedure to identify the necessary mandatory and non-mandatory training required to be completed by each individual onboard before being assigned to a vessel and/or prior to promotion. For the Master this should define:

�	The ship handling training required prior to promotion to the rank of Master onboard any fleet vessel.
�	The ship handling training required prior to being reassigned to a vessel with handling characteristics significantly different from those of the vessels in which they have recently served.
�	Where the required training included a shore-based ship handling training course, the maximum period for which a course may be considered valid prior assignment to a vessel type before the training would need to be refreshed or repeated.

Training may consist of supervision onboard company vessels which is formally documented through a competency development process or may be delivered at an approved shore-based training centre.

Where training is delivered during a parallel voyage prior to taking over command on a vessel with significant different handling characteristics the vessel operator should have defined the activities that must have been completed by the incoming Master and assessed and documented by the incumbent Master or a suitably qualified Superintendent prior to the incoming Master taking command.

The vessel operator should have evaluated the handling characteristics of the vessel types under its management and identified the circumstances in which additional ship handling training will be required when a Master is reassigned to a vessel type having significantly different handling characteristics to those which they had recently served.

When evaluating the handling characteristics of vessels under management considerations should include the number and types of propellers / drives, the number and types of rudders and the number and types of thrusters fitted to each vessel and not be limited solely to size.

Service as Master on a vessel with a specific set of handling characteristics within the previous five years will be considered as sufficient and appropriate experience when transferring from one vessel type to another.

The operator should have developed procedures for the operation, testing, maintenance and log keeping of the GMDSS VHF, MF and HF radio and satellite communications equipment. These should include the method chosen to ensure availability of GMDSS equipment at sea.

Details of equipment fitted can be found in the Record of Approved GMDSS Radio Installation. SOLAS defines three methods to ensure availability of GMDSS equipment at sea.
�	At sea electronic maintenance, requiring the carriage of a qualified radio/electronic officer and adequate spares and manuals.
�	Duplication of certain equipment
�	Shore based maintenance
Ships engaged on voyages in sea areas A1 and A2 are required to use at least one of the three maintenance methods outlined above, or a combination as may be approved by their administration. Ships engaged on voyages in sea areas A3 and A4 are required to use at least two of the methods outlined above.

In most cases, A3 ships carry duplicate equipment and use shore-based maintenance, A1 and A2 ships use shore- based maintenance only. The choice of using shore-based maintenance does not infer there should necessarily be a contract and/or agreement, but that maintenance should be carried out annually by a shore-based 'expert' organisation.

GMDSS equipment is required to be powered from three sources of supply:

�	The ship's normal supply.
�	The ship's emergency generator (if fitted)
�	A dedicated radio battery supply.

The batteries must be charged by an automatic charger that is powered by the main and emergency generators.

The batteries are required to have the capacity to power the equipment for 1 hour on ships with an emergency generator, and 6 hours on ships not fitted with an emergency generator.

The capacity of the battery or batteries should be checked, using an appropriate method, annually. One method of checking the capacity of an accumulator battery is to fully discharge and recharge the battery, using normal operating current and period (e.g. 10 hours), when the ship is not at sea. (i.e. will not require the GMDSS equipment for watchkeeping purposes until the batteries are fully charged after the test)

10.1	The Company should establish procedures to ensure that the ship is maintained in conformity with the provisions of the relevant rules and regulations and with any additional requirements which may be established by the Company.
","Inspection Guidance

To ensure that cargo hoses can be safely disconnected in the event of a single component failure of the cargo hose crane, there should be the capability to replace a defective hydraulic hose or other essential mechanical component with an available spare.

Where a vessel is fitted with two identical hose handling cranes, hydraulic hoses and other critical mechanical components can be exchanged between cranes as a temporary measure.

Where a vessel is fitted with a single hose handling crane, the vessel operator should have conducted a risk assessment to identify those crane components that may fail during operation and then to have made provision for an appropriate stock of spare parts to be carried. Items to be considered by the risk assessment should include but not be limited to:

�	Hydraulic hoses.
�	Complete winch motors or a comprehensive set of manufacturers recommended spare parts
�	Complete hydraulic pumps or a comprehensive set of manufacturers recommended spare parts.
�	Lifting and luffing wires as appropriate to the design of the crane.

It is an OCIMF expectation that at least one hydraulic hose of each size and length fitted to the hose handling crane should be carried as a spare.

Where a vessel is fitted with a special purpose crane for lightering or offshore hose handling in addition to two standard hose handling cranes, the special purpose crane should be treated as if it were a single crane unless it shared the same components as the standard hose handling cranes.

The details of each marine diesel engine installed on board to which MARPOL Annex VI regulation 13 applies can be found in paragraph 2.2.1 of the vessel�s International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) Certificate.

The level of NOx emissions for each engine is described by Tier designation. Tier I and Tier II status is usually achieved via engine design. Tier III status is achieved by the use of additional equipment such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. Such equipment is not run continuously and must be operating to achieve Tier III status. Thus engines may be run at Tier II or Tier III depending upon local requirements. Engines must be operating in Tier III mode in a NOx Emission Control Area that applies to the vessel.

NOx Emission Control Areas apply as follows:

�	Baltic Sea for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2021.
�	North Sea for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2021.
�	North American for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2016.
�	United States Caribbean Sea for vessels constructed after 1 Jan 2016.

MARPOL Annex VI and the NOx Technical Code require Technical Files for each of these diesel engines to be maintained on board, together with the following records in relation to NOx emissions:

�	A Record Book of Engine Parameters for those engines required to undergo Engine Parameter Checks at initial and subsequent surveys.

","Inspection Guidance

Although paragraph 3 of SOLAS II-1/reg 35-1 applies to passenger ships, arrangements such as described may be required in tankers by flag and/or class rules.

The purpose of the �bilge injection system�, �direct suction� or ��emergency bilge suction� is to discharge overboard large quantities of sea water from engine room bilges in an emergency using the main circulating pump or another suitable large pump.
 
The vessel operator should have developed procedures for the use of the emergency bilge pumping arrangements in the machinery spaces. These should include guidance on:

�	The use of the various pumps connected to the bilge system, their direct suctions and overboard valves.
�	The use of the emergency bilge suction. The emergency bilge suction valve should be readily accessible and clearly marked as to its purpose.
�	MARPOL requirements concerning the discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixtures necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea or resulting from damage to a ship or its equipment. The emergency bilge discharge arrangements must not be used for the disposal of daily machinery space bilge accumulations.
�	Ship specific requirements to seal emergency bilge suction and/or overboard valves, depending on the ship�s equipment and design, to prevent unauthorised discharge of oil or oily mixtures.
�	The marking of system valves and controls to ensure correct operation and avoid accidental opening.

Positive evidence that a valve has not been opened can be provided by use of a numbered seal, the number of which should be recorded in an official document such as the Engine Room Log Book or the Oil Record Book Part I. Such a method of sealing must be easily breakable to allow the valve to be opened in an emergency.

The vessel-specific instructions for pumping of the machinery space bilges in an emergency may be included as part of the vessel emergency response plan for machinery space flooding.

Emergency overboard discharge valve(s) should be provided with a notice warning against accidental opening.

o	Control of local and remote access to the IT and OT systems.
o	Control of the use of personal devices on board.
o	Equipment disposal including data destruction.
o	Contingency plans for possible cyber incidents.

Spaces containing sensitive IT or OT control equipment should be securely locked.

Physical access to sensitive user equipment (such as exposed USB ports on bridge systems and wi-fi hub ports) should be secured or disabled.
 
All on-board computers should be protected by anti-virus software, and this should be kept updated.

Only senior officers should have administrator profiles and the responsibility for maintaining user profiles should be clearly set out. User profiles should only allow workstations etc. to be used for their intended purpose. User profiles should be carefully managed, and redundant profiles deleted.

Generic user profiles and passwords should not be passed on as part of crew changes. Passwords should be changed regularly.

Back-up facilities should be available and used to assist recovery following a cyber incident.

OT systems critical to navigation and propulsion should have backup systems enabling quick and safe recovery after a cyber incident.

Application software should be regularly updated with security patches and upgrades.

Crew members should receive cyber security training as appropriate to their responsibilities and duties.

Cyber security awareness should be actively promoted on board using for example, posters, CBT or online courses.

Computer access for visitors such as surveyors, technicians etc. should be restricted. Unauthorised access to sensitive OT computers should be prohibited. There should be procedures for the approval of access to sensitive networks, including remote access.

Procedures should strictly restrict the use of portable media. Where use is unavoidable, such media should be checked for malware etc. in a computer not connected to the ship�s control network.

The following is a sample non-exhaustive list of cyber incidents, which should be addressed in plans for onboard contingencies. These incidents may be addressed in the company�s procedures for dealing with shipboard emergencies as required by the ISM Code�s Chapter 8 (Emergency preparedness).

�	Loss of availability of electronic navigational equipment or loss of integrity of navigation related data.
�	Loss of availability or integrity of external data sources, including but not limited to GNSS.

7 The Company should establish procedures, plans and instructions, including checklists as appropriate, for key shipboard operations concerning the safety of the personnel, ship and protection of the environment. The various tasks involved should be defined and assigned to qualified personnel.
","Inspection Guidance

The vessel operator should have developed procedures for the operation of the primary and secondary cargo tank venting systems in accordance with SOLAS which described:

�	The primary and secondary system for each anticipated cargo tank/group configuration.
�	The associated settings of the pressure/vacuum sensor alarms, where fitted.
�	Maintenance, test and calibration procedures for the cargo tank pressure/vacuum monitoring system per the manufacturer�s instructions.

These procedures may be contained in the vessel�s cargo handling manual(s) and/or the planned maintenance system.

In the case of inerted vessels, if pressure sensors are provided as the means of secondary protection, the alarm settings for the pressure sensors must be set to actuate when the tank pressure reaches 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves themselves. In the case of the low-pressure settings, the pressure in a tank should never be permitted to fall below zero and the pressure sensors should be set to alarm above zero.

In the case of non-inerted vessels if pressure sensors are provided, the over-pressure setting should be set to alarm at either 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the pressure valves or slightly higher than the pressure at which the pressure valve meets the maximum load rate for the tank as measured from the pressure flow diagram.
The vacuum setting should be either 10% greater than the normal actuation settings of the vacuum valves or slightly higher than the vacuum at which the vacuum valve meets the maximum discharge rate for the tank as measured from the vacuum flow diagram.

At no time should the alarm settings for the pressure sensors exceed the safe design pressures of the cargo tank.

Class societies may accept a system that may not comply with the SOLAS requirements for 'secondary means of allowing full flow relief'. In such cases an observation should still be made.

If the vessel is described in the IOPPC Form B 1.11.4 as a Crude oil/Product carrier and carries crude and products simultaneously, the cargo tank vapour isolating valve will be intentionally closed to prevent vapour carryover. In such cases, both primary and secondary protection must be provided on the cargo tank side of the cargo tank vapour isolating valve.

The vessel operator will have described the secondary venting arrangements fitted to the vessel though the pre- inspection questionnaire. The description provided will be inserted in the inspection editor and the final report.

The response to HVPQ questions 9.10.6 and 9.10.7 (where applicable) will be inserted in the inspection editor for the information of the inspector.","Potential Grounds for a Negative Observation

It is generally accepted that steel blanks should be of the same thickness as the flanges to which they are attached, but this will not necessarily result in the pressure capability being the same as that of the associated pipework. It is the pressure rating of the blank which is important, and blanks made of materials such as titanium have a superior strength and may therefore be significantly thinner for the same pressure rating as a mild steel blank.

The vessel operator should have developed procedures for managing cargo and vapour connections at the cargo manifolds. These procedures should include:

�	Manifold connection via hose or marine loading arm.
�	In LNG vessels, procedures for disconnection, including:
o	Lining up to drain the system from the MLA, and/or manifold, to shore or ship tank.
o	Isolation of liquid and vapour valves on either side of the manifold connection.
o	Removal of liquid from the MLA, and/or manifolds, to shore or ship tank.
o	Purging of flammable vapours from the connection.
o	Verification that the target conditions (flammable gas concentration) have been achieved, using a meter calibrated for measuring methane in nitrogen.
o	Disconnection of the manifold.
�	The fitting and monitoring of pressure gauges at each manifold connection outboard of the manifold valve.
�	The fitting of blanks to all unused manifold connections.
�	The fitting of blanks or caps to all vents, drains and sample points, except while in use.
�	The use of fixed and portable drip-trays and the management of drained or spilled cargo.
�	The management of vapour manifolds and connections.
�	Safe work on elevated manifold platforms, if fitted.
�	The supporting of cargo hoses during cargo transfer.
 
�	Restrictions on the use of the mid-ships hose-handling crane(s) during cargo operations.
�	The management of bow and stern manifolds, if fitted.
�	The hazards associated with low temperature cargoes.
�	The use of manifold strainers

The offshore manifolds on LNG carriers are often pressurised with nitrogen and it is normal that the space between the manifold valve and the flange is under pressure. This does not indicate valve leakage. Valve leakage would be indicated by frosting.

Gratings on LNG tanker manifold drip trays are sometimes made of two different materials; gratings near to the connections may be of stainless steel, and the gratings on the periphery made of composite material. The stainless- steel gratings are designed to bear the point load of the cargo arm supports in the event of a PERC�s release. If, however, the loading arm supports are located on the composite section, the vessel should confirm that they are constructed of sufficient strength to take the point load.

Manifold drip trays for LNG transfers should be kept as dry as reasonably practical. Water should not be introduced deliberately, or rain-water allowed to accumulate. This will prevent rapid phase transition in the event of a spill.

Manifold drip-tray drains to deck should be fitted with valves and either capped or plugged. Pressure gauge stems should be fitted with valves and capped whenever gauges are not fitted.
It is generally accepted that steel blanks should be of the same thickness as the flanges to which they are attached, but this will not necessarily result in the pressure capability being the same as that of the associated pipework. It is the pressure rating of the blank which is important, and blanks made of materials such as titanium have a superior strength and may therefore be significantly thinner for the same pressure rating as a mild steel blank. If such blanks are fitted, documentation should be on board to prove that the pressure rating is adequate for the service.

Manifold strainers may be fitted at the option of the terminal or the vessel. The provision of the strainers may be by the terminal or by the vessel. Where fitted they must be in good order and frequently checked and cleaned as required. Many strainers are designed for one-way flow only. They should not be by-passed.

Manifold valves and lines should be clearly marked as to whether they are liquid or vapour.

Non-essential personnel should be kept clear of the manifold area during cargo operations and access should be visibly restricted.

","Inspection Guidance

By IMO regulation, all oil tankers, chemical tankers and gas carriers must be fitted with a stability instrument, capable of verifying compliance with intact and damage stability requirements.

It is a class requirement that all oil tankers, chemical tankers and gas carriers over 100 metres in length must be fitted with a loading instrument for calculating SF/BMs etc.

In most cases these requirements will be combined in one stability and loading instrument, which may be computer based.

Class approvals for stability and loading instruments are made under a type approvals process. Type-approval certificates are generally valid for periods of not more than five years.

IMO: MSC.1/Circ.1221 states that the validity of the type approval certificate itself has no influence on the operational validity of a product accepted and installed onboard ship and that a product manufactured during the period of validity of the relevant type approval certificate need not be renewed or replaced due to the expiry of such type approval certificate.

The condition of seawater pipelines, sea chests, storm valves, hull penetrations and seawater pumps should be carefully checked to ensure that they are in satisfactory condition. All coatings should be checked for failure, particularly pitting and/or hard rust.

Special attention should be paid at the following locations:

�	Outboard of ship-side valves.
�	Pipe bends and elbows.
�	Clips and supports, where there may be wear and thinning due to vibration.
�	Fixed expansion joints (bellows) for deformation.
�	Wet areas or locations of localised leakage where there may be accelerated corrosion.
�	Hidden areas where there may be unnoticed problems.

Any necessary local repair should be treated as temporary only. Permanent repairs usually involve the removal and replacement of a length of piping. After the repair has been completed, pipe supports, or clips should be refitted. A permanent repair should only be done with classification society approved materials, and subsequently examined and approved by a class surveyor.

The following are not acceptable as a permanent repair.
 
�	Welded doublers.
�	Expansion joints.
�	Mismatched materials e.g. mild steel and stainless steel.
�	Material of different thickness in the same piping run.

Patent couplings are not acceptable as a permanent repair except where they had been fitted as part of the original design. Where such couplings are installed, inspectors should ascertain that they conform with the original plans/design.

","Inspection Guidance

The vessel operator should have developed procedures to ensure that cargo and ballast systems remain operable in sub-zero temperatures. The procedures should list all cargo and ballast systems susceptible to damage or loss of functionality by exposure to low temperatures, and the measures to be adopted to avoid malfunction. Winterisation checklists should be used to facilitate preparations.
 
Precautions to be taken may include, where applicable:

�	Testing the integrity of deck lines prior to use to ensure they are tight.
�	Checking ballast water salinity and exchanging if necessary.
�	Where fitted, operating ballast tank heating or bubbling systems in good time.
�	Protecting equipment on deck with canvas covers, including:
o	Hydraulic cargo and COW valves.
o	COW machines.
o	P/V valves.
o	Mast riser vent valve.
o	IG main and inlet valves.
o	Deepwell pump motors and shafts.
o	Ballast tank vents.
�	Checking that:
o	Valves on deck are well greased and their gearboxes free of water.
o	Deck seal heating arrangements are operational.
o	Anti-freeze levels in P/V breaker and stripping system vacuum pumps are correct.
o	Cargo compressors that require antifreeze and/or a heating system are identified and prepared for cold weather.
�	Draining equipment, including:
o	Cargo, COW, and tank cleaning lines and valves, after testing or use.
o	Tank cleaning heater.
o	Heating coils.
o	Manifold drip-trays.
o	Deck air-line.
o	Ballast system, including ballast monitor.
o	Oil discharge monitoring system.
o	Pumproom steam lines, if not to be used.
�	Activating hydraulic cargo, COW and ballast valves frequently while in sub-freezing temperatures to avoid freezing/blockage.
�	Checking P/V breaker, P/V valves and flame screens immediately before commencing and during cargo operations.
�	Starting cargo pump and valve hydraulic systems in good time before they are needed.
�	Ensuring deck seal heating is functioning and checked regularly during cargo operations.
�	Checking canvas covers are removed from ballast tank vents before ballasting/deballasting.

The vessel operator should have developed procedures to ensure that deck machinery, including mooring systems, remains operable in sub-zero temperatures. The procedures should list all deck machinery susceptible to damage or loss of functionality by exposure to low temperatures, and the measures to be adopted to avoid malfunction.

Winterisation checklists should be used to facilitate preparations prior to entering an area of sub-zero temperatures. Periodic inspections of all deck machinery should be undertaken during the exposure to sub-zero temperatures to ensure the effectiveness of the precautions being taken, which may include:

�	Ensuring hydraulic systems contain a suitable grade of hydraulic oil.
�	Circulating hydraulic system oil continuously when the external temperature was below 0�C to ensure that the fluid systems are maintained at working temperatures.
�	When leaving machinery (e.g., winches) running, paying careful attention to the regular lubrication of the equipment.
�	Operating and testing cargo handling cranes prior to the vessel entering sub-zero temperatures.
�	Checking heating arrangements in cranes are operational.
�	Adequately covering the pneumatic or electrical motors used for raising or lowering accommodation ladders to prevent ice accretion.
�	Closing the main air valve to deck and draining the airline down.
�	Protecting control boxes and motion levers for deck machinery with canvas covers.
�	Protecting mooring wires and synthetic ropes with canvas covers to stop ice accretion until they are required for use.
